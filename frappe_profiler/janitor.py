"""Periodic cleanup of stale profiler sessions.

Wired into hooks.py as a scheduler_event running every 5 minutes. Catches
two failure modes:

  1. A user clicked Start, walked away, and never clicked Stop. After 10
     minutes the Redis active pointer auto-expires (TTL on the key) but
     the Profiler Session DocType row is still in `Recording` state with
     no path forward.

  2. A worker crashed mid-analyze, leaving a row in `Analyzing` state with
     no in-flight job. Without the janitor it would sit there forever.

Both cases are handled by force-stopping the session: clear the Redis
state, mark the row as Stopping, and enqueue analyze.run. If the analyze
itself was the failure cause, it will retry once and end up in `Failed`
on the next attempt — at least the row no longer pretends to be live.
