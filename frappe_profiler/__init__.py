# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# frappe.enqueue monkey-patch (Phase 2)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We wrap frappe.utils.background_jobs.enqueue so that when a user with an
# active profiler session enqueues a background job, the session UUID rides
# along inside the job's kwargs as `_profiler_session_id`. The before_job
# hook in hooks_callbacks.py reads this key (and pops it before the method
# runs, so the method's signature isn't disturbed) and activates recording
# for the job.
#
# This is the only way to make background-job profiling work without forking
# frappe — the worker process is a fresh interpreter that has no idea who
# enqueued the job, but RQ preserves kwargs verbatim across the queue boundary.
#
# Patched at app-import time. Idempotent via the `_profiler_patched` marker
# so re-imports during dev (e.g. `bench update`) don't double-wrap.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# at call time so they're no-ops for non-recording users.
#
# Both layers are wrapped in try/except: the install itself, AND the
# logging fallback. In test contexts that stub `frappe` with a minimal
# fake module (e.g. test_enqueue_patch.py), `install_wraps()` may raise
# because `frappe.permissions` / `frappe.utils.redis_wrapper` aren't
# present, AND `frappe.log_error` may not exist either. Both failures
# are silent — the v0.2.0 enqueue patch above uses the same defensive
# pattern (`pass` on any exception) for the same reason.
