"""Tests for v0.5.2 split of findings into
"Findings — what to fix" (actionable, concrete fixes) vs
"Observations" (framework/system/informational — no direct fix).

Per user feedback: "In Findings — what to fix, Show only the valid
fixes." The split keeps the main action-list tight and reads as a
punchlist while the Observations section preserves full-picture
transparency.
