"""Tests for the v0.5.3 regenerate_reports API.

The endpoint re-invokes renderer.render_safe / render_raw against an
existing Profiler Session WITHOUT re-running the analyzer pipeline.
Use cases:

  - Report template was upgraded; existing sessions should reflect
    the new layout without paying the analyze cost again.
  - The original render crashed (bug in renderer) and a fix was
    deployed. regenerate_reports re-runs the render on the fixed
    code.
  - An admin wants to re-render after manually editing an analyzer-
    derived field (rare, but possible).

Contract checked here via source-inspection + behavior under
stubbed frappe (the endpoint itself needs a live bench for
integration tests, which the harness doesn't provide).
