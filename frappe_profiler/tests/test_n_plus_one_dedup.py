"""Tests for v0.5.2 round 3 callsite-level N+1 dedup.

Before: n_plus_one grouped by (normalized_query, filename, lineno).
A callsite that generated 10 different queries in the same loop
emitted 10 separate N+1 findings. Report had "Same query ran 74×"
ten times — same fix, same line.

After: grouped by (filename, lineno). A callsite with N query
variants emits ONE finding titled "Callsite ran X queries (N
variants) at file:line" with sample queries in the detail.
