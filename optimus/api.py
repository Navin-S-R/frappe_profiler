"""Whitelisted HTTP API for the profiler.

These endpoints are how the floating widget (Phase 5) and any custom
integrations talk to the profiler. They are decorated with
`@frappe.whitelist()` so they are reachable as
`/api/method/optimus.api.<name>`.

Phase 1 surface:
    start(label)         — begin a session for the calling user
    stop()               — end the current user's session
    status()             — is the calling user currently recording?
    get_active_session() — full metadata for the calling user's session

The actual analyze pipeline (read recordings, run analyzers, render
report, attach files) is added in Phase 3+. For now, `stop()` simply
clears the active flag and marks the DocType as `Stopping` — a future
phase will hook the analyze step in.

	When `bench disable-scheduler` is in effect (or the "Enable
	Scheduler" toggle in System Settings is off), many deployments
	don't have a `bench worker` processing the RQ queue either, so
	an enqueued analyze job would sit forever and the session would
	hang in the "Stopping" state. In that case we fall back to
	``frappe.enqueue(now=True)`` which executes analyze synchronously
	inside the current request. See v0.5.0 design spec §6.

	Inline analyze has a recording-count safety cap
	(``optimus_inline_analyze_limit``, default 50) to stay within
	gunicorn's ~120s request timeout on heavy sessions. When the cap
	is exceeded, the session is marked Failed with an actionable
	error and analyze is NOT invoked — the user sees the failure
	immediately rather than having gunicorn kill the request
	mid-analyze and strand the session half-analyzed.

	The cap lives here (not in ``_stop_session``) so every caller of
	this function — ``stop``, ``retry_analyze``, ``janitor._sweep_stale``
	— gets the same protection. Earlier versions only applied it in
	``_stop_session``, which meant ``retry_analyze`` on a 200-recording
	failed session on a scheduler-disabled site would hit the gunicorn
	timeout.

	Args:
	    session_uuid: the session to analyze.
	    docname: the Optimus Session docname for cap-exceeded failure
	        handling. When provided, cap violations mark this doc Failed
	        with a user-facing message. When None, the cap is skipped
	        (internal callers only — all production paths pass docname).

	Returns True if the session is already finalized (Ready or Failed)
	by the time this call returns — that is, analyze ran synchronously
	OR was rejected by the inline cap. Returns False when the job was
	pushed to the async queue and the session is still Stopping.

	Inline execution can fail — analyze.run catches its own exceptions
	and marks the session as Failed via frappe.db.set_value, then
	re-raises. We catch the re-raise here so the caller's response
	isn't a 500 error. Returning True with the session already
	marked Failed lets the caller read the final status off the doc

	Unlike ``retry_analyze``, this does NOT re-run any analyzer. It

	changed (e.g. upgrading optimus to a new version with an
	improved layout) and you want the new UI applied to an already-
	analyzed session without the cost of re-running the entire
	analysis pipeline.

	Characteristics:

	  - **Fast** — milliseconds vs. minutes. No DB-heavy analyzer
	    passes, no EXPLAIN calls. Just template rendering.
	  - **Safe to run repeatedly** — idempotent. Each invocation
	    replaces the existing report File attachment and clears
	    the cached PDF.
	  - **Best-effort recordings** — fetches the original recordings
	    from Redis by UUID. If they've expired (TTL exceeded),
	    per-query drill-down / Full recordings sections render empty
	    but every other section (findings, stats, hot frames, exec
	    summary, analyzer notes) stays intact because those are

	  - **Allowed on Ready OR Failed sessions** — re-rendering a
